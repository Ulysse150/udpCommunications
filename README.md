# UDP-TCP Communications

4 codes that can simulate an UDP or TCP communication between a server and a client. This project made in groups of 3 was realized during my second year of university.

# How to use it ?

First compile all 4 files. This will create an .exe for each.

Open `2 shells`, in one of them, launch a server program, in the other one, launch a client one. You can now communicate between both shells.

Always launch the same type of communication in both shells. Don't use `server.tcp` and `client.udp` for instance.
